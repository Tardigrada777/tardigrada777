I'm a Senior Software Engineer and Tech Lead at [CloudGeometry](https://www.cloudgeometry.io/). With 6+ years in the field, I'm all about crafting rock-solid software that doesn't just work, but solves real business challenges.

For me, engineering isn't just about churning out code. It's about honing those problem-solving skills and building systems that stand the test of time. Always up for a good tech challenge!

## üìç Location

Outside of work, I call Belgrade home, where I live with my wonderful wife and our adorable toddler daughter. While we're enjoying our time here, we're also actively working towards our long-term goal: relocating to the United States. It's not just a dream for us ‚Äì it's a plan we're committed to making a reality in the coming years!

## üìö Hobbies and Interests

When I'm not knee-deep in code, you'll probably find me with my nose in a book ‚Äì I'm a big fan of tech reads and psychology page-turners. They keep my mind sharp and feed right back into my passion for building rock-solid, business-savvy software systems.

I'm always pushing myself to level up my problem-solving game. It's not just about writing clever code; it's about engineering solutions that stand the test of time and make a real impact.

Btw, I've got a secret identity as a budding sci-fi author. I love cooking up futuristic worlds and mind-bending plots. Recently, I've been exploring the fascinating intersection of AI and creative writing. I'm constantly tinkering with fine-tuning models and crafting prompts to see how AI can enhance the storytelling process. It's like bringing my two passions together in one exciting experiment!

If you love Sci-Fi - ([have a look](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CQWM3Q9Z?ref_=dbs_m_mng_rwt_calw_tkin_0&storeType=ebooks))!

## üéì Education

- **University**: University of London (2024...now), Bachelor of Computer Science
  - **Focus**: Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)
